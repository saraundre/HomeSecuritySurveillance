Topic:  Home security surveillance 

*************************************************
Background: 
*************************************************

 At present, there are more and more safety accidents in families, such as short circuit, fire, gas leakage, illegal intrusion and other scenes. It is worth exploring to methods of home security surveillance based on videos from home installed cameras. It combines with AI analysis and training algorithms to solve the problem of home AI safety monitoring.
 
This system realizes the functions of monitoring, identification and alarm of key areas and specific scenes of the family with video technology, combined with AI analysis and training algorithm:


(1) It detects smoke and flame, and raises the alarm. 

(2) The room entrants are detected within a specified period of time. It raises the alarm when strangers break in.
